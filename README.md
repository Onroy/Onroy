- 👋 Hi, I’m @Onroy, a BSc. Computer Engineering graduate with 3 years' experience in Hardware design, development and analytics. I've recently started learning application programming for PCs and mobile.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Python DevOps and a dash of hardware design and development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Data Analytics, Automation(Network and Data Reporting) and Visualization for Telcos, Financial Markets and FMCGs and Finacial services companies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting ML or CV projects; I'm a data and creative junkie, also, a hardware design enthusiast...
I aim to become a full-fledged ML and Python DevOps Engineer in the next 2 Years, so that's where my focus is currently.
